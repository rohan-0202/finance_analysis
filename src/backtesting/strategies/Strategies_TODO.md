# Sophisticated Trading Strategies Documentation

Based on your codebase, I can suggest several sophisticated trading strategies that go beyond your basic implementations. These strategies leverage various market data (OHLC, options, news) while introducing more advanced concepts.

## 1. Volatility Regime-Adaptive Strategy

### Intuition

Markets operate in different volatility regimes, and trading signals that work in low-volatility environments may fail in high-volatility conditions. This strategy dynamically adjusts its parameters and position sizing based on the current volatility regime.

### Mathematical Framework

1. Define volatility regimes using rolling standard deviation of returns:

   - Low volatility: σ < 0.5 × historical median σ
   - Normal volatility: 0.5 × median σ ≤ σ ≤ 1.5 × median σ
   - High volatility: σ > 1.5 × historical median σ

2. For each regime, use different indicator parameters:

   - Low volatility: Tighter RSI bands (e.g., 40/60 instead of 30/70)
   - High volatility: Wider RSI bands (e.g., 20/80)

3. Position sizing scales with inverse volatility:
   - Position size = Base size × (Target volatility ÷ Current volatility)

### Implementation Notes

- Calculate rolling standard deviation (20-day) of daily returns
- Categorize current regime using historical percentiles
- Maintain separate performance metrics for each regime

## 2. Options-Enhanced Mean Reversion

### Intuition

Mean reversion strategies can be enhanced by incorporating options sentiment data. When normal mean reversion signals appear alongside confirming options activity, the probability of successful trades increases significantly.

### Mathematical Framework

1. Begin with standard mean reversion signals (e.g., RSI < 30 for oversold)
2. Calculate options sentiment score:

   - S = w₁(P/C ratio percentile) + w₂(IV skew z-score) + w₃(unusual options activity score)
   - Where w₁, w₂, w₃ are weights determined by historical effectiveness

3. Combined signal strength = Mean reversion signal × (1 + Options sentiment multiplier)
   - Where options sentiment multiplier scales with S

### Implementation Notes

- Requires historical options data analysis to determine optimal weights
- Only trade when both technical and options signals align
- Different weights for different market sectors

## 3. Multi-Timeframe Momentum with Volume Confirmation

### Intuition

True momentum is evident across multiple timeframes with supporting volume. This strategy triangulates momentum signals across different time horizons before making trading decisions.

### Mathematical Framework

1. Calculate momentum indicators on multiple timeframes:

   - Short (e.g., 5 days): M₁ = (close - close₅) / close₅
   - Medium (e.g., 20 days): M₂ = (close - close₂₀) / close₂₀
   - Long (e.g., 60 days): M₃ = (close - close₆₀) / close₆₀

2. Calculate volume confirmation:

   - V = (Volume₅ - Volume₆₀) / Volume₆₀

3. Combined momentum score:

   - M = α₁M₁ + α₂M₂ + α₃M₃
   - Where α are timeframe weights that sum to 1

4. Trade when:
   - M > threshold AND V > volume threshold (for buys)
   - M < -threshold AND V > volume threshold (for sells)

### Implementation Notes

- Normalize indicators to z-scores for comparability
- Adjust thresholds dynamically based on market volatility
- Consider sector-specific volume patterns

## 4. News Sentiment Augmented Technical Analysis

### Intuition

Technical signals that align with sentiment from financial news are more likely to be successful. This strategy combines standard technical analysis with news sentiment to filter signals.

### Mathematical Framework

1. Generate baseline technical signals (e.g., from MACD, RSI)
2. Calculate a news sentiment score:

   - Sentiment = Σ(sentiment_scoreᵢ × recency_weightᵢ) / Σ(recency_weightᵢ)
   - Where recency_weight = e^(-λ × days_old)

3. Adjust technical signals:
   - If sentiment strongly confirms technical signal: increase position size
   - If sentiment contradicts technical signal: reduce position size or ignore signal
   - Formally: Position multiplier = 1 + γ × sentiment_score

### Implementation Notes

- Use LLM-generated sentiment scores from your existing news analysis system
- Optimize recency decay parameter λ through backtesting
- Sentiment is more important for certain sectors (e.g., retail, tech) than others

## 5. Implied Volatility Surface Trading Strategy

### Intuition

The options implied volatility surface contains rich information about market expectations. Abnormal changes in the IV surface often precede significant price movements.

### Mathematical Framework

1. Monitor the implied volatility surface across strikes and expirations
2. Calculate IV surface metrics:

   - Term structure slope = (IV_long - IV_short) / (days_long - days_short)
   - Skew steepness = (IV_OTM_put - IV_ATM) / (K_OTM - K_ATM)

3. Generate signals based on significant changes:

   - Flattening term structure + steepening skew → bearish
   - Steepening term structure + flattening skew → bullish

4. Signal strength scales with magnitude of change:
   - S = |ΔTerm structure| + |ΔSkew|

### Implementation Notes

- Establish baseline IV surface for each ticker (using at least 30 days of history)
- Calculate daily z-scores of changes relative to historical patterns
- Different thresholds for different sectors and market caps

## 6. Adaptive Regime-Switching Strategy

### Intuition

Financial markets switch between trending, mean-reverting, and chaotic regimes. An effective strategy should detect the current regime and apply the most appropriate trading approach.

### Mathematical Framework

1. Define regime detection metrics:

   - Hurst exponent (H): H > 0.5 indicates trend, H < 0.5 indicates mean reversion
   - Autocorrelation of returns: positive for trending, negative for mean-reverting
   - VIX and VIX rate of change: high/increasing for chaotic regime

2. For each regime:

   - Trending: Apply momentum strategy (e.g., MACD, moving average)
   - Mean-reverting: Apply RSI with appropriate bounds
   - Chaotic: Reduce position sizing or stay in cash

3. Regime probability model:
   - P(Regime) = f(Hurst, Autocorrelation, VIX, VIX_RoC)
   - Where f is a logistic function mapping indicators to regime probabilities

### Implementation Notes

- Calculate regime metrics over rolling windows of various lengths
- Use ensemble approach to combine regime signals
- Implement smooth transitions between regimes to avoid whipsaws

## 7. Options Market Makers' Gamma Exposure Strategy

### Intuition

Market makers' gamma exposure significantly influences intraday market dynamics, especially near options expiration dates. By modeling this exposure, we can anticipate potential price support/resistance levels and volatility patterns.

### Mathematical Framework

1. Calculate market-wide gamma exposure:

   - Gamma exposure = Σ(open_interest × contract_gamma × contract_price)
   - Net gamma = call_gamma - put_gamma

2. Identify gamma flip points (price levels where net gamma changes sign)

3. Trading rules:
   - High positive gamma → market tends to mean-revert near current price
   - High negative gamma → market tends toward increased volatility
   - Trading into gamma flip point → potential for acceleration of move

### Implementation Notes

- Focus on major indices or high options volume stocks
- Most important around monthly/quarterly expirations
- Requires accurate options chain data with greeks

## 8. Statistical Arbitrage with Pairs Trading

### Intuition

Correlated securities tend to move together over time. When they temporarily diverge, there's an opportunity to profit by buying the underperformer and selling the outperformer, expecting convergence.

### Mathematical Framework

1. Identify pairs with high correlation and cointegration:

   - Calculate Pearson correlation over 1-year lookback
   - Perform Augmented Dickey-Fuller test on spread
   - Calculate half-life of mean reversion

2. Standardize the spread:

   - z = (spread - mean) / std_dev

3. Trading rules:
   - Enter when |z| > threshold (typically 2)
   - Exit when z returns to 0 or crosses opposite threshold
   - Stop loss when |z| > max_threshold (typically 3-4)

### Implementation Notes

- Form pairs within same industry/sector for better correlation
- Ensure sufficient liquidity in both securities
- Monitor correlation stability over time

## 9. Volatility Risk Premium Harvesting

### Intuition

Options implied volatility typically exceeds realized volatility, creating a persistent risk premium that can be harvested through systematic selling of options with proper risk management.

### Mathematical Framework

1. Calculate volatility risk premium:

   - VRP = implied_volatility - historical_realized_volatility

2. Identify options with high VRP relative to historical norms:

   - VRP_z_score = (current_VRP - avg_VRP) / std_dev_VRP

3. Strategy variations:
   - Short strangles when VRP is high
   - Iron condors for defined risk
   - Systematically roll positions to maintain constant exposure

### Implementation Notes

- Implement strict position sizing (e.g., max 1-2% of portfolio per position)
- Use portfolio margin for efficiency if available
- Dynamic adjustment of strikes based on VRP magnitude

## 10. Ensemble Model with Dynamic Weighting

### Intuition

Different strategies work better in different market conditions. An ensemble approach combines multiple sub-strategies with weights that adapt based on recent performance.

### Mathematical Framework

1. Run multiple sub-strategies in parallel:

   - Technical (e.g., RSI, MACD)
   - Options-based (e.g., put/call ratio, IV analysis)
   - Volume-based (e.g., OBV, volume profile)

2. Calculate dynamic weights using exponential performance weighting:

   - w_i = exp(λ × sharpe_i) / Σ(exp(λ × sharpe_j))
   - Where sharpe_i is the recent Sharpe ratio of strategy i

3. Combined position sizing:
   - Position = Σ(w_i × position_i)

### Implementation Notes

- Rebalance weights periodically (e.g., weekly or monthly)
- Include a "cash" or "risk-off" strategy in the ensemble
- Tune λ parameter to control adaptation speed

## Implementation Priority Ranking

Here's a suggested implementation priority based on potential effectiveness and complexity:

1. Volatility Regime-Adaptive Strategy (foundation for others)
2. Options-Enhanced Mean Reversion (leverages your existing capabilities)
3. Multi-Timeframe Momentum with Volume Confirmation (relatively straightforward)
4. News Sentiment Augmented Technical Analysis (uses your existing news analysis)
5. Ensemble Model with Dynamic Weighting (can incorporate other strategies as they're built)
