## Introduction to MACD

The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is one of the most popular technical indicators in trading. Developed by Gerald Appel in the late 1970s, MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security's price.

MACD is valued by traders for its ability to identify:
- Changes in the strength, direction, momentum, and duration of a trend
- Potential buy and sell signals
- Overbought or oversold conditions

## Components of MACD

The MACD indicator consists of three main components:

1. **MACD Line**: The difference between the fast EMA and slow EMA of the price.
2. **Signal Line**: An EMA of the MACD line itself.
3. **Histogram**: The visual representation of the difference between the MACD line and the signal line.

Visually, the MACD typically appears as:
- A line chart showing the MACD line and signal line
- A histogram showing the difference between these two lines

## How MACD is Calculated

The calculation of MACD involves several steps:

### 1. Calculate the Fast and Slow EMAs

First, we calculate the Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) of the price data:

```python
def calculate_ema(series: pd.Series, span: int) -> pd.Series:
    """Calculate the Exponential Moving Average for a series."""
    return series.ewm(span=span, adjust=False).mean()
```

The EMA gives more weight to recent prices compared to a simple moving average. The formula for EMA is:

EMA(today) = (Price(today) × k) + (EMA(yesterday) × (1 – k))

Where k = 2 ÷ (span + 1)

### 2. Calculate the MACD Line

The MACD line is the difference between the fast EMA and the slow EMA:

```python
# Calculate EMAs
ema_fast = calculate_ema(price_data["close"], fast_period)
ema_slow = calculate_ema(price_data["close"], slow_period)

# Calculate MACD line
macd_data["macd"] = ema_fast - ema_slow
```

By default, the fast period is 12 days and the slow period is 26 days:

MACD Line = 12-day EMA - 26-day EMA

### 3. Calculate the Signal Line

The signal line is an EMA of the MACD line itself:

```python
# Calculate signal line
macd_data["signal"] = calculate_ema(macd_data["macd"], signal_period)
```

By default, the signal period is 9 days:

Signal Line = 9-day EMA of MACD Line

### 4. Calculate the Histogram

The histogram visually represents the difference between the MACD line and the signal line:

```python
# Calculate histogram
macd_data["histogram"] = macd_data["macd"] - macd_data["signal"]
```

Histogram = MACD Line - Signal Line

## Interpreting MACD Signals

MACD generates several key trading signals:

### Signal Line Crossovers

The most common signals are generated when the MACD line crosses the signal line:

```python
# Identify crossover points
buy_signals = (macd_data["macd"] > macd_data["signal"]) & (
    macd_data["macd"].shift() <= macd_data["signal"].shift()
)
sell_signals = (macd_data["macd"] < macd_data["signal"]) & (
    macd_data["macd"].shift() >= macd_data["signal"].shift()
)
```

- **Bullish Crossover**: When the MACD line crosses above the signal line, it suggests bullish momentum and a potential buy signal.
- **Bearish Crossover**: When the MACD line crosses below the signal line, it suggests bearish momentum and a potential sell signal.

### Zero Line Crossovers

When the MACD line crosses the zero line:
- **Bullish**: MACD crossing above the zero line indicates that the short-term average is now above the long-term average, suggesting bullish momentum.
- **Bearish**: MACD crossing below the zero line indicates that the short-term average is now below the long-term average, suggesting bearish momentum.

### Divergences

Divergence occurs when the price action doesn't match the MACD movement:
- **Bullish Divergence**: Price makes a lower low while MACD makes a higher low, suggesting potential upward reversal.
- **Bearish Divergence**: Price makes a higher high while MACD makes a lower high, suggesting potential downward reversal.

## Advantages and Limitations

### Advantages
- Combines trend following and momentum indicators
- Provides clear visual signals
- Can be applied to any time frame and most tradable assets
- Effective for identifying trend changes and momentum shifts

### Limitations
- As a lagging indicator, signals may come after price movements have begun
- Can generate false signals, especially in range-bound markets
- Requires confirmation from other indicators or analysis for best results
- Different timeframes might produce conflicting signals

## Implementation in Code

The provided implementation in `macd.py` follows these steps:

1. **Retrieve historical price data**:
```python
price_data = get_historical_data(ticker_symbol, db_name, days)
```

2. **Calculate MACD components**:
```python
# Calculate EMAs
ema_fast = calculate_ema(price_data["close"], fast_period)
ema_slow = calculate_ema(price_data["close"], slow_period)

# Calculate MACD line
macd_data["macd"] = ema_fast - ema_slow

# Calculate signal line
macd_data["signal"] = calculate_ema(macd_data["macd"], signal_period)

# Calculate histogram
macd_data["histogram"] = macd_data["macd"] - macd_data["signal"]
```

3. **Generate trading signals**:
```python
# Identify crossover points
buy_signals = (macd_data["macd"] > macd_data["signal"]) & (
    macd_data["macd"].shift() <= macd_data["signal"].shift()
)
sell_signals = (macd_data["macd"] < macd_data["signal"]) & (
    macd_data["macd"].shift() >= macd_data["signal"].shift()
)
```

4. **Get the latest signal and statistics**:
```python
def get_latest_macd_signal(ticker_symbol, ...):
    signals = get_macd_signals(ticker_symbol, ...)
    # Return the most recent signal if any exist
    if signals:
        return signals[-1]
    return None
```

## Advanced MACD Strategies

### 1. Multiple Timeframe Analysis
Using MACD across different timeframes (daily, weekly, monthly) to confirm trends and signals.

### 2. MACD Histogram Analysis
- Watching for histogram peaks and valleys to time entries and exits
- Looking for histogram divergences from price

### 3. Combining MACD with Other Indicators
- Pairing MACD with RSI (Relative Strength Index) to confirm overbought/oversold conditions
- Using MACD with support/resistance levels for higher probability trades
- Combining MACD with volume indicators for additional confirmation

### 4. Parameter Customization
Adjusting the standard parameters (12, 26, 9) for different assets or trading styles:
- Shorter periods for more frequent signals (e.g., 5, 13, 4)
- Longer periods for longer-term trend identification (e.g., 19, 39, 9)

MACD remains one of the most reliable and versatile technical indicators available to traders. While no indicator is perfect, understanding how MACD works and implementing it correctly can significantly improve trading decisions and market analysis.
